\chapter{Introduction}


The goal of this project is to implement a library to solve \emph{Markov decision processes (MDPs)}. The focus is on extensibility, facilitating modern C++ features like smart pointers as well as following well-established C++ guidelines and best-practices. 

The first chapter is a brief introduction into the problem class for which the library functionality is developed.  

In the second chapter the focus is on the actual implementation. The class hierarchy is described as aspects of the build and test environment.

\chapter{Introduction}


The goal of this project is to implement a library to solve \emph{Markov decision processes (MDPs)}. The focus is on extensibility and facilitating modern C++ features as well as following well-established C++ guidelines and best-practices. 

The second chapter is a brief introduction into MDPs for which the library functionality is developed.  

The third chapter describes important use cases for the library and requirements that are derived from those.

In the fourth chapter the focus is on the actual implementation.  The library interface, class hierarchies and design patterns are described that are used to meet the requirements. Also the exemplary application is introduced. 
Building and testing the library is part of the following chapter. 

The last chapter is devoted to considerations about potential extensions of the library and how they could be integrated.
